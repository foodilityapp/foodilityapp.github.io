    Hi, Foodility Users. <br><br>
    Version 1.2.9 will contain the following bug fixes and features
    <span><p>
    <li>Save default unit for water and weight.</li>
    <li>Medication PDF export.</li>
    <li>Email linking bug fix.</li>
    <li>Password reset bug fix.</li>
    </p></span>
    Also, for the past 1 year and 10 months, we have provided Foodility as a completely FREE app. We have implemented lots of functionalities, but in order to support our app development and provide more features, we will experiment with subscription model with ads. More details will come soon, but for now, every feature currently implemented as of version 1.3.0 will stay FREE with ads.
    <br><br>Thanks for using Foodility and let's stay healthy!

  Version 1.2.8 will be available in the next few days. This update brings redesigned setting menu and support for iOS 13. Also, we added an explicit 'Sync Device' in the menu, which downloads any changes you made in your other iOS devices onto your current device. Note, this will only work if you registered with Foodility using email or gmail. Thanks!

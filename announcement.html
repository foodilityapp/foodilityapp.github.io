    Hi Foodility users, we are aware of the issue where the app keeps asking for Apple ID. We are actively trying to fix this asap. Ideally, it should be fixed and a new version of the app should be available by early next week. Thanks!

    Hi Foodility users, we will soon be terminating anonymous user sign up feature. Those who had already signed up can continue to use it, but you won't be able to skip registeration in about a month. We are removing anonymous account due to unstable user experience for anonymous account users. For those who had already signed up using the anonymous feature, we strongly encourage you to link your email or gmail and get verified. Thanks!

  Hi Foodility users!<br><br>
  We have been working on a new version that would now be shipped with an option for a Premium subscripion.
  It is not live on the app store yet, but it will be in a few days.
  We are currently thinking of a monthly price of $2.99 USD, and a yearly price of $29.99 USD.<br><br>
  Some of the features that have already been implemented in our code for Premium are the following.<br>
  - PDF Export with range, and combined export, with photos<br>
  - Customizable Presets<br>
  - Customizable Tag for General Note<br>
  - Customizable Dot Color for Calendar<br><br>
  Additional feature that will be free for everyone <br>
  - Optional calorie <br><br>
  We are also fixing a bug where posting a Weight post couldn't upload photos.<br><br>
  Thank you very much for your support, and if you have any feedback on any of the upcoming changes, please feel free to email us! We would like to listen to you before making this update, and if you have any other features that you think would like to be included, please let us know!

  Hi Foodility users, you can now update to version 1.3.0 to remove every ad until we find a better way to monetize our app. Thanks!

    Hi Foodility users. We are sorry about our recent sudden introduction of ads on our app, but we are actually <b>removing the ads</b> until we find a better way to monetize our app. The new app is waiting for Apple's review on App store. Most likely, we will implement a subscription model with very low monthly subscription fees, but until then, this app is going back to completely FREE. Again, we are really sorry about a sudden Ads introduction without any warning and it would also be extremely helpful for us if you could give us feedbacks regarding how much monthly fee would be appropriate for ads-free experience with a lot of add-on features. Some of the add-on features we plan to implement very soon are preset notes, ability to edit presets, custom note label, and single summary view. If you have any other suggestions about how we could monetize our app, please let us know using the "feedback" button! Thank you.

  Version 1.2.8 will be available in the next few days. This update brings redesigned setting menu and support for iOS 13. Also, we added an explicit 'Sync Device' in the menu, which downloads any changes you made in your other iOS devices onto your current device. Note, this will only work if you registered with Foodility using email or gmail. Thanks!

    Hi Foodility users. We are sorry about our recent sudden introduction of ads on our app, but we are actually <b>removing the ads</b> until we find a better way to monetize our app. The new app is waiting for Apple's review on App store. Most likely, we will implement a subscription model with very low monthly subscription fees, but until then, this app is going back to completely FREE. Again, we are really sorry about a sudden Ads introduction without any warning and it would also be extremely helpful for us if you could give us feedbacks regarding how much monthly fee would be appropriate for ads-free experience with a lot of add-on features. Some of the add-on features we plan to implement very soon are preset notes, ability to edit presets, custom note label, and single summary view. If you have any other suggestions about how we could monetize our app, please let us know using the "feedback" button! Thank you.

  Version 1.2.8 will be available in the next few days. This update brings redesigned setting menu and support for iOS 13. Also, we added an explicit 'Sync Device' in the menu, which downloads any changes you made in your other iOS devices onto your current device. Note, this will only work if you registered with Foodility using email or gmail. Thanks!

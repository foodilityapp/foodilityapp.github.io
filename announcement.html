  We are pushing a new update (1.2.8) with redesigned setting, menu and support for iOS 13. Also, we added an explicit 'Sync Device' in the menu, which will sync data betwee your iOS devices and download your latest data into your current device.
  1.2.8 update should be available in the next few days once Apple reviews Foodility. Thanks!

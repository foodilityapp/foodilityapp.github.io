  Version 1.2.8 will be available in the next few days. This update brings redesigned setting menu and support for iOS 13. Also, we added an explicit 'Sync Device' in the menu, which downloads any changes you made in your other iOS devices onto your current device. Note, this will only work if you registered with Foodility using email or gmail. Thanks!
